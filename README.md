# World_Weather_Analysis
## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to obtain weather data from OpenWeather.com and Google's API. A set of 2000 latitudes and longitudes were randomly generated and sent to OpenWeather to obtian the conditions in the nearest cities. The latitudes and longitudes were then passed through google's API to obtain the nearest hotel to the city. After attempting a radius of 5km very few results appeared. The radius was then increased to 20km to get more results. Unfortunately the popup code was not able to run successfully.
